# Discord-Crash-MP4-Generator

## How it works

By splitting a Video into multiple pieces (usually 2 is enough) and changing the PixelFormat of one to something different, then merging them back will cause the Chromium Media Player to Shit itself and take Discord down with it, since Discord is built on Electron and Electron is Chromium Based.

You can make it even more consistent by Encoding the Mp4 with NVidia Hardware Acceleration.

## Notice

This was a one time Project, it might not work after some time anymore. At the time of writing this (9th April 2021), it still works.

If you find a new or better way to Crash Discord, please make a Pull Request or Fork the Repository.
